## üéØ **Priority KPIs Identification**

### **KPI #1: [Most Promising KPI]**
- **Source Report**: [Report Name]
- **Data Quality**: [Assessment]
- **Simulation Match**: [Which simulation output this validates]
- **Expected Error Range**: [Estimation based on data quality]

### **KPI #2: [Second Priority KPI]**
- **Source Report**: [Report Name]
- **Data Quality**: [Assessment]
- **Simulation Match**: [Which simulation output this validates]
- **Expected Error Range**: [Estimation based on data quality]

### **KPI #3: [Third Priority KPI]** (If available)

## üìä **Data Preparation for Validation Framework**

### **Validation Dataset Creation:**
```csv
kpi_name,unit,period,year,observed_value,source_type,source_institution,source_document,confidence_level,methodology,notes
[KPI_NAME],tons_per_month,annual,2023,[VALUE],direct,[INSTITUTION],[DOCUMENT],high,[METHOD],[NOTES]
```

### **Simulation Parameters to Extract:**
Based on identified KPIs, extract these values from simulation results:
- [ ] `simulationResults.high.[relevant_metric]` for high season
- [ ] `simulationResults.low.[relevant_metric]` for low season  
- [ ] `simulationResults.high.economics.[cost_metric]` for economic validation
- [ ] Convert daily values to monthly/annual as needed

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Gaps and Limitations**

### **Missing Data Points:**
- [ ] [List KPIs that are needed but not available]
- [ ] [Identify what additional sources might fill these gaps]

### **Data Quality Concerns:**
- [ ] [Note any methodological concerns]
- [ ] [Document uncertainty sources]
- [ ] [Flag data that needs proxy adjustments]

### **Validation Constraints:**
- [ ] [Limited temporal data (single point vs. time series)]
- [ ] [Geographic mismatch (regional vs. Holbox-specific)]
- [ ] [Seasonal availability (annual vs. seasonal breakdown)]

## üìà **Next Steps After Analysis**

### **If Sufficient Data (‚â•2 solid KPIs):**
1. [ ] Format data for validation framework input
2. [ ] Run validation analysis using `realDataComparison.js`
3. [ ] Document results and error analysis
4. [ ] Proceed to Day 2: Online database search for complementary data

### **If Limited Data (<2 solid KPIs):**
1. [ ] Document available data thoroughly  
2. [ ] Prioritize Day 2: Intensive online search for additional sources
3. [ ] Prepare for Day 3: Proxy data collection and analysis
4. [ ] Consider qualitative validation approaches

### **Success Criteria for Day 1:**
- [ ] **Minimum**: 1 quantitative KPI with clear methodology
- [ ] **Target**: 2 quantitative KPIs from existing reports
- [ ] **Bonus**: Additional contextual data for benchmarking

## üìù **Documentation for Thesis**

### **Academic Citation Template:**
```
[Report Author]. ([Year]). [Report Title]. [Institution]. 
Used for validation of [specific KPI] in waste management simulation model.
Data extracted: [specific metric] = [value] [units] for [context].
Methodology: [brief description of how data was collected/calculated].
```

### **Limitation Documentation:**
```
The validation of this model was conducted using available reports and studies 
rather than comprehensive primary data collection, reflecting the practical 
constraints of undergraduate thesis research and the typical data availability 
challenges faced by practitioners in remote island locations.

Data sources include:
1. [List primary sources]
2. [List secondary sources]  
3. [Proxy adjustments made]

This approach establishes a foundation for future comprehensive validation 
when additional primary data becomes available.
```
