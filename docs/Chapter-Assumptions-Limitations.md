# Chapter 5: Model Assumptions and Limitations

## Abstract

This chapter provides a comprehensive analysis of the assumptions and limitations inherent in the waste management simulation model for Isla Holbox. It demonstrates intellectual honesty by explicitly documenting all model simplifications, their rationale, and potential impact on results. The analysis categorizes assumptions into mathematical, operational, data, and temporal types, quantifying their potential impact using sensitivity analysis findings. This transparent approach strengthens the model's credibility and provides a roadmap for future research and model refinements.

## 5.1 Introduction

### 5.1.1 Purpose and Scope

Model assumptions and limitations are inevitable in any simulation system, particularly when modeling complex real-world processes like waste management systems. The transparent documentation of these assumptions serves multiple critical purposes:

1. **Intellectual Honesty**: Acknowledging the boundaries and constraints of model applicability
2. **Credibility Enhancement**: Demonstrating awareness of model limitations increases scientific rigor
3. **Future Research Direction**: Identifying areas where model improvements would provide highest value
4. **User Guidance**: Helping decision-makers understand appropriate model use cases and interpretation

### 5.1.2 Methodology for Assumption Analysis

This analysis employs a systematic approach combining:

- **Code Analysis**: Line-by-line review of `useWasteSimulation.tsx` to identify implicit assumptions
- **Mathematical Review**: Examination of formalized equations from Chapter 3 for simplifications
- **Sensitivity Integration**: Using findings from Chapter 4 (Sensitivity Analysis) to quantify assumption impact
- **Literature Comparison**: Benchmarking assumptions against waste management modeling standards

### 5.1.3 Classification Framework

Assumptions are categorized into four primary types:

1. **Mathematical Assumptions**: Simplifications in mathematical formulation
2. **Operational Assumptions**: Simplifications in system operation modeling
3. **Data Assumptions**: Limitations in parameter estimation and data availability
4. **Temporal Assumptions**: Simplifications in time-dependent behavior modeling

## 5.2 Mathematical Assumptions

### 5.2.1 Steady-State Operation Assumption

**Assumption**: The model assumes steady-state operation where daily operations are consistent and predictable.

**Implementation in Code**:
```javascript
// src/hooks/useWasteSimulation.tsx
// Daily calculations assume identical operations each day
for (let day = 1; day <= 30; day++) {
  // Same calculation logic applied uniformly
  const dailyGeneration = calculateDailyGeneration(day);
  // No variation in operational efficiency or external factors
}
```

**Mathematical Representation**:
```
G_daily(t) = G_base × M_seasonal × O_occupancy
// Where G_daily is constant for each season, not varying by day
```

**Rationale**: 
- Simplifies calculation complexity from stochastic to deterministic
- Enables clear baseline comparisons and policy analysis
- Reflects planning-level analysis rather than operational-level detail

**Potential Impact**: 
- **Magnitude**: Medium impact on operational planning
- **Direction**: May underestimate variability-induced costs and capacity requirements
- **Sensitivity Evidence**: From Chapter 4, daily variations would primarily affect collection costs (11.9% system impact) and capacity utilization

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Use model for strategic planning rather than day-to-day operations
- Apply safety factors to capacity sizing based on expected variability
- Future model versions could incorporate stochastic daily variation

### 5.2.2 Linear Mass Balance Equations

**Assumption**: All waste flows follow linear mass balance equations without non-linear interactions.

**Mathematical Representation**:
```
Material_out = Material_in × (1 - Leak_rate) × Efficiency_rate
// Linear relationship, no threshold effects or economies of scale
```

**Implementation Evidence**:
```javascript
// Linear processing throughout the system
const processedWaste = inputWaste * (1 - leakRate) * efficiencyRate;
// No modeling of capacity thresholds or performance degradation
```

**Rationale**:
- Mathematically tractable and computationally efficient
- Enables clear cause-effect relationships for policy analysis
- Consistent with engineering-level analysis standards

**Potential Impact**:
- **Magnitude**: Low to medium impact on system design
- **Direction**: May miss economies of scale benefits or threshold effects
- **Real-world Comparison**: Most waste systems do exhibit some non-linear behaviors at very high or low utilization rates

### 5.2.3 Independence of Waste Streams

**Assumption**: RSU, Sargassum, and RCD waste streams are processed independently without interaction.

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Separate processing for each waste stream
const rsuResults = processRSU(rsuInputs);
const sargassumResults = processSargassum(sargassumInputs);
const rcdResults = processRCD(rcdInputs);
// No cross-stream resource sharing or competition modeled
```

**Rationale**:
- Reflects current Holbox operational reality where streams are largely separate
- Simplifies model structure and parameter estimation
- Enables stream-specific policy analysis

**Potential Impact**:
- **Magnitude**: Low impact given current Holbox infrastructure
- **Direction**: May miss opportunities for integrated processing or resource sharing
- **Future Relevance**: Becomes more significant as system sophistication increases

## 5.3 Operational Assumptions

### 5.3.1 Perfect Information and Control

**Assumption**: Operators have perfect information about system state and perfect control over operations.

**Code Evidence**:
```javascript
// No modeling of information delays or control limitations
if (inventory > capacity) {
  // Immediate perfect response assumed
  processWaste(inventory, optimalRate);
}
```

**Real-world Reality**: 
- Information about waste volumes may be delayed or imprecise
- Operational responses to changing conditions take time
- Equipment maintenance and breakdowns cause temporary inefficiencies

**Potential Impact**:
- **Magnitude**: Medium impact on operational efficiency estimates
- **Direction**: Overestimates system efficiency by 5-15% based on literature
- **Sensitivity Connection**: Affects collection efficiency parameters (identified as medium impact in Chapter 4)

### 5.3.2 Uniform Waste Composition

**Assumption**: Waste composition remains constant across sources, seasons, and time.

**Implementation**:
```javascript
const wasteComposition = {
  organic: 0.45,    // Fixed percentages
  recyclable: 0.25,
  non_recyclable: 0.30
};
// Applied uniformly across all generation sources
```

**Real-world Variability**:
- Tourist season brings different waste composition (more packaging, less organic)
- Hotel waste differs significantly from residential waste
- Economic conditions affect consumption patterns and waste composition

**Potential Impact**:
- **Magnitude**: Medium to high impact on recovery and valorization potential
- **Direction**: May overestimate or underestimate recovery rates depending on actual composition
- **Quantification**: Could affect recovery rates by ±20-30% based on composition variance

### 5.3.3 Technology Static Assumption

**Assumption**: Technology and operational efficiency remain constant throughout the analysis period.

**Justification**: 
- Focuses on system design rather than technological development
- Enables comparison of policy alternatives under consistent technological baseline
- Reflects realistic timeframe for infrastructure planning (5-10 years)

**Limitations**:
- Does not capture potential efficiency improvements over time
- May underestimate long-term cost reductions from technological advancement
- Does not model learning effects or operational optimization over time

## 5.4 Data Assumptions

### 5.4.1 Parameter Certainty Assumption

**Assumption**: All parameters are treated as point estimates rather than distributions with uncertainty.

**Current Implementation**:
```javascript
const wasteGenerationRate = 1.2; // kg/room/day - single value
// No uncertainty distribution modeled
```

**Reality of Parameter Uncertainty**:
- Most parameters have ±10% to ±30% uncertainty ranges (documented in Anexo-Fuentes-Datos.md)
- Uncertainty propagates through calculations, affecting result confidence
- Some parameters (especially costs) may have higher uncertainty

**Impact Quantification from Sensitivity Analysis**:
Based on Chapter 4 findings:
- **High uncertainty parameters**: Final transport capacity (30.7% impact), collection costs (11.9% impact)
- **Medium uncertainty parameters**: Generation rates (5-11% impact)
- **Low uncertainty parameters**: Population, basic operational parameters (1-3% impact)

**Mitigation in Current Analysis**:
- Sensitivity analysis provides bounds on uncertainty impact
- Parameter documentation (Chapter 2) identifies uncertainty sources
- Model calibration (Chapter 3) validates parameter reasonableness

### 5.4.2 Data Representativeness Assumption

**Assumption**: Available data sources adequately represent Holbox system characteristics.

**Data Source Analysis**:
- **Primary data**: Own 2022 field study (high representativeness)
- **Secondary data**: Regional and national statistics (medium representativeness)
- **Engineering estimates**: Literature values adapted to local context (variable representativeness)

**Limitations**:
- Limited temporal coverage (single year primary data)
- Some parameters estimated from proxy locations
- Informal sector activities difficult to quantify precisely

**Validation Evidence**:
- Chapter 3 validation achieved 100% validation rate with 13.1% average error
- Strong correlation (R² = 0.94) between model and field data
- Demonstrates reasonable data representativeness for core parameters

## 5.5 Temporal Assumptions

### 5.5.1 Seasonal Simplification

**Assumption**: Complex annual seasonality is simplified to binary high/low season model.

**Current Model**:
```javascript
const seasonalMultiplier = isHighSeason ? 
  general.highSeasonOccupancy : general.lowSeasonOccupancy;
// Binary seasonal model: high (90%) vs low (20%) occupancy
```

**Real-world Complexity**:
- Gradual transitions between seasons rather than binary switches
- Multiple seasonal patterns (Christmas, Easter, summer, hurricane season)
- Weekly and monthly variations within seasons
- Weather-dependent variations in waste generation and collection efficiency

**Impact Assessment**:
- **Planning Level**: Low impact - captures primary seasonal variation
- **Operational Level**: Medium impact - misses shorter-term variations
- **Sensitivity Evidence**: High season occupancy shows 5.2% system impact (Chapter 4)

**Current Adequacy**:
- Sufficient for strategic planning and infrastructure sizing
- Primary seasonal effect (tourism) is captured accurately
- Model serves intended purpose despite temporal simplification

### 5.5.2 Economic Stationarity Assumption

**Assumption**: Economic conditions (costs, prices, exchange rates) remain constant.

**Model Implementation**:
```javascript
const costs = {
  collection: 800,      // pesos/ton - constant
  transport: 1200,      // pesos/ton - constant
  disposal: 400         // pesos/ton - constant
};
// No inflation, currency fluctuation, or market changes modeled
```

**Real-world Economic Dynamics**:
- Inflation affects operational costs (typically 3-6% annually in Mexico)
- Fuel price variations significantly impact transportation costs
- Labor cost changes affect collection operations
- Economic cycles influence waste generation patterns

**Impact Quantification**:
- **Short-term (1-2 years)**: Low impact, within model uncertainty bounds
- **Medium-term (3-5 years)**: Medium impact, could affect ROI calculations by 10-20%
- **Long-term (5+ years)**: High impact, fundamental economic assumptions may not hold

## 5.6 Environmental and External Assumptions

### 5.6.1 Climate Stability Assumption

**Assumption**: No extreme weather events or climate change impacts are modeled.

**Current Scope**: Model focuses on normal operational conditions without considering:
- Hurricane impacts on waste generation and system operation
- Sea level rise effects on infrastructure
- Extreme weather disruptions to collection and transport
- Climate change impacts on tourism patterns

**Risk Assessment for Holbox Context**:
- **Hurricane Season**: Annual risk of major disruption (historically every 3-5 years)
- **Sea Level Rise**: Long-term infrastructure threat
- **Extreme Weather**: Increasing frequency of intense storms

**Model Appropriateness**:
- **Planning Applications**: Adequate for baseline infrastructure sizing
- **Risk Management**: Should be supplemented with disaster planning
- **Long-term Strategy**: Climate adaptation considerations needed

### 5.6.2 Regulatory Stability Assumption

**Assumption**: Current regulatory framework remains unchanged throughout analysis period.

**Current Regulatory Assumptions**:
- Waste classification and handling requirements remain constant
- Environmental regulations maintain current standards
- Municipal authority structure and responsibilities unchanged
- Federal/state waste management policies stable

**Regulatory Change Risks**:
- **Environmental Standards**: Potential tightening of disposal regulations
- **Extended Producer Responsibility**: Possible implementation affecting waste flows
- **Climate Policies**: Carbon pricing or waste reduction mandates
- **Tourism Regulations**: Changes affecting visitor patterns and waste generation

## 5.7 Model Boundary Assumptions

**Exclusions**:
- Mainland disposal facility operations and impacts
- Off-island waste treatment technology specifics
- Regional waste management system interactions
- Upstream impacts of consumption (product lifecycle)

**Boundary Appropriateness**:
- **Municipal Planning**: Appropriate for local decision-making authority
- **Environmental Impact**: Captures primary local environmental effects
- **Economic Analysis**: Includes costs under municipal control

### 5.7.2 Stakeholder Scope Limitation

**Assumption**: Model focuses on municipal operations without detailed stakeholder behavior modeling.

**Current Scope**:
- Municipal government as primary decision-maker
- Aggregate tourism and residential behavior
- Private sector as service providers

**Excluded Stakeholder Dynamics**:
- Individual business waste reduction strategies
- Tourist education and behavior change programs
- Community participation and social dynamics
- Inter-municipal cooperation possibilities

**Impact on Policy Recommendations**:
- **Technical Solutions**: Well-supported by model
- **Social Programs**: May underestimate implementation challenges
- **Behavioral Interventions**: Limited guidance from current model scope
