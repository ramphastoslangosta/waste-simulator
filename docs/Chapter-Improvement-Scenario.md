# Chapter 6: Evidence-Based Improvement Scenario for Isla Holbox

## Abstract

This chapter presents a comprehensive improvement scenario for Isla Holbox's waste management system, designed using evidence-based recommendations derived from the sensitivity analysis findings (Chapter 4). The scenario targets the three most influential system parameters identified through quantitative analysis: final transport capacity (30.7% system impact), collection costs (11.9% impact), and restaurant waste generation management (11.5% impact). The improvement scenario demonstrates potential system performance gains, provides detailed return-on-investment analysis, and presents a realistic implementation roadmap for municipal decision-makers.

### 6.4.5 VALIDATED THESIS CONCLUSIONS

#### **🎯 CRITICAL FINDING: Valorization is Not Optional**

The corrected simulation results provide **definitive evidence** that valorization programs are not enhancement options but **fundamental system requirements**:

1. **System Failure Without Valorization**: All non-valorization scenarios (1,4,6,7) show inventory accumulation of 127-337 tons, indicating complete system breakdown within 30 days.

2. **Transport Capacity Bottleneck**: Current 8 tons/day transport capacity is **82% insufficient** for baseline waste flows (44.12 tons/day requirement).

3. **Valorization as System Rescue**: Composting programs single-handedly reduce transport requirements by 67-81%, transforming system failure into operational success.

#### **🏆 OPTIMAL SOLUTION VALIDATED: SCENARIO-3**

**Evidence-Based Recommendation**: Composting (10.72 tons/día) + Enhanced Separation Programs

**Quantitative Justification**:
- ✅ **Achieves System Stability**: 0.38 tons final inventory (vs 337 tons failure)
