## üîÑ **Conversion for Simulation Comparison**

### **Primary Validation KPIs**

#### **KPI 1: Total Waste Generation**
```
Original Data: 34.8 tons/day (2022 estimate)
Converted For Simulation: 1,044 tons/month
Conversion Factor: 34.8 √ó 30 = 1,044
Annual Equivalent: 12,702 tons/year
Seasonal Notes: No seasonal breakdown in source data
```

#### **KPI 2: Collection Efficiency**
```
Original Data: 28.15% collection rate
Simulation Equivalent: Collection efficiency parameter
Notes: Only 28.15% of generated waste actually leaves the island
Gap: 71.85% remains on island (major system constraint)
```

#### **KPI 3: Per Capita Generation Rate**
```
Residential: 1.98 tons/day √∑ 2,673 inhabitants = 0.74 kg/hab/day
Commercial: 32.8 tons/day (tourism-driven)
Total System: 34.8 tons/day for 2,673 permanent residents
Note: Commercial generation dominates (94.3% of total)
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Data Quality Assessment**

### **Reliability Factors:**
- ‚úÖ **Methodology Transparency**: Detailed methodology documented
- ‚úÖ **Source Credibility**: Own research with multiple data sources
- ‚úÖ **Temporal Relevance**: 2022 data, very current
- ‚úÖ **Geographic Accuracy**: Holbox-specific, exact match
- ‚úÖ **Multiple Validation**: Cross-referenced with historical reports

### **Confidence Levels:**
- **Total Generation (34.8 tons/day)**: HIGH - Comprehensive analysis
- **Collection Rate (28.15%)**: HIGH - Field-verified data
- **Population Data (2,673)**: HIGH - Official census
- **Commercial Breakdown**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Survey-based with projections

### **Potential Uncertainties:**
- Seasonal variations not captured in detail
- Informal waste recovery may be underestimated
- Tourist population fluctuations affect generation significantly

## üéØ **Validation Expectations**

### **Simulation vs. Reality Comparison:**
1. **Waste Generation**: Our simulation should be within 15-25% of 34.8 tons/day
2. **Collection Efficiency**: Major system constraint - only 28.15% collected
3. **Commercial Dominance**: 94.3% non-residential aligns with tourism model
4. **Population Base**: 2,673 permanent residents as baseline

### **Key Validation Insights:**
- **System Bottleneck**: Collection is major constraint, not generation
- **Tourism Impact**: Commercial generation 16.6x higher than residential
- **Infrastructure Gap**: 71.85% of waste not properly managed
- **Scale Match**: 34.8 tons/day is realistic for island tourism model
