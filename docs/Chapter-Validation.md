# Chapter 4: Model Validation Against Real-World Data

## Abstract

This chapter presents the validation of the waste management simulation model against available data sources for Isla Holbox, Q. Roo, Mexico. The validation process uses existing reports, online databases, and proxy data from similar locations to assess model credibility within the constraints of undergraduate thesis timeline and data availability.

## 4.1 Introduction

Model validation is a critical step in establishing the credibility and practical applicability of simulation models for real-world decision making. This validation process follows the framework established in VALIDATION-003 and compares simulation results against verifiable historical data from Holbox's waste management system.

### 4.1.1 Validation Objectives

1. **Accuracy Assessment**: Quantify how closely simulation results match real-world data
2. **Error Analysis**: Calculate percentage errors for key system metrics  
3. **Credibility Establishment**: Demonstrate model reliability for policy recommendations
4. **Limitation Identification**: Document where model assumptions diverge from reality

### 4.1.2 Validation Scope and Constraints

**Scope Definition**: This validation adopts a pragmatic approach suitable for undergraduate thesis constraints, utilizing:
- **Existing reports** provided by contacts and collaborators
- **Online public databases** (INEGI, SEMARNAT open data)
- **Proxy data** from demographically similar Caribbean islands
- **Academic literature** with quantitative references to the region

**Target KPIs** (adapted to data availability):
- **Waste generation rates** (per capita or total volumes)
- **Economic indicators** (costs, budgets, or operational metrics)  
- **System performance** (collection efficiency, disposal patterns)

## 4.2 Methodology

### 4.2.1 Revised Data Collection Strategy

#### Tier 1: Existing Reports and Documents (Priority: Highest)
- **Source**: Previously shared reports from contacts and collaborators
- **Expected Data**: Direct quantitative metrics from Holbox or region
- **Reliability**: High (primary sources with known methodology)
- **Timeline**: Immediate analysis (1 day)

#### Tier 2: Online Public Databases (Priority: High)
- **INEGI**: Municipal waste statistics for Quintana Roo
- **SEMARNAT Open Data**: Environmental monitoring and waste characterization
- **Government Transparency**: Municipal budgets and operational costs
- **Timeline**: Systematic search (1-2 days)

#### Tier 3: Proxy Data from Similar Islands (Priority: Medium)
- **Cozumel**: Demographic and tourism-adjusted waste data
- **Isla Mujeres**: Similar island tourism dynamics
- **Caribbean Studies**: Regional waste generation patterns
- **Timeline**: Comparative analysis with adjustments (1 day)

#### Tier 4: Academic and Technical Literature (Priority: Supporting)
- **Keywords**: "residuos sólidos Yucatán", "island waste management", "tourism waste"
- **Databases**: Google Scholar, SciELO, ResearchGate
- **Purpose**: Contextual validation and parameter verification

### 4.2.2 Adapted Statistical Validation Framework

The validation uses the comprehensive framework implemented in `src/utils/realDataComparison.js` with adjustments for limited data availability:

#### Error Calculation Methods
```javascript
// Percentage Error (primary metric for limited data)
PE = |Simulated - Observed| / Observed × 100%

// Weighted Mean Absolute Percentage Error (accounts for data quality)
WMAPE = Σ(weight_i × |Simulated_i - Observed_i| / Observed_i) × 100%

// Confidence-adjusted Root Mean Square Error
RMSE_adj = √[(1/n) × Σ(confidence_i × (Simulated_i - Observed_i)²)]
```

#### Adjusted Error Thresholds for Limited Data Context
```javascript
errorThresholds: {
  excellent: 15,    // Direct data from existing reports
  good: 25,         // Online databases and government sources  
  acceptable: 40,   // Proxy data from similar islands
  poor: Infinity    // Requires documentation and limitation notes
}
```

#### Data Quality Weighting System
- **Direct Reports**: Weight = 1.0 (full confidence)
- **Government Data**: Weight = 0.85 (high confidence)
- **Academic Proxy**: Weight = 0.70 (medium confidence)
- **Demographic Adjusted**: Weight = 0.60 (documented uncertainty)

### 4.2.3 Validation Scenarios

The validation tests three scenarios against historical data:

1. **Base Scenario**: Default simulation parameters
2. **Calibrated Scenario**: Parameters adjusted based on available local data
3. **Seasonal Comparison**: High vs low season validation (if data available)

## 4.4 Preliminary Model-Reality Comparison

### 4.4.1 Expected Validation Challenges

Based on model assumptions and typical data availability:

#### Likely High-Accuracy Areas
- **Waste generation per capita**: Well-established coefficients in literature
- **Seasonal variation patterns**: Strong tourism correlation data available

#### Potential Discrepancy Areas  
- **Collection efficiency**: Real-world logistics complexity
- **Informal recycling**: Difficult to quantify in formal reports
- **Leakage rates**: Often underreported in official data

### 4.4.2 Sensitivity to Parameter Uncertainty

Key parameters that may require calibration based on real data:

```javascript
// High uncertainty parameters for validation adjustment
wastegenerationPerPersonPerDay: {
  current: 1.5,  // kg/person/day
  uncertainty: ±20%,
  calibration_target: "Municipal generation data"
},

collectionEfficiency: {
  current: 0.90,  // 90%
  uncertainty: ±15%, 
  calibration_target: "Collection route data"
},

seasonalMultiplier: {
  high_season: 2.5,
  uncertainty: ±30%,
  calibration_target: "Tourism occupancy correlation"
}
```

2. **Collection logistics**: Real-world efficiency vs theoretical capacity
3. **Economic factors**: Actual costs vs model estimates

## 4.6 Model Calibration and Adjustment

### 4.6.1 Parameter Calibration Process

Based on validation results, key parameters may be adjusted:

```javascript
// Calibration methodology
1. Identify parameters with highest error contribution
2. Adjust within reasonable uncertainty bounds
3. Re-run simulation with calibrated parameters
4. Document calibration rationale and impact
```

### 4.6.2 Validation Iteration

If initial validation shows errors >30%:
1. **Root cause analysis**: Identify major discrepancy sources
2. **Model refinement**: Adjust assumptions or add complexity
3. **Re-validation**: Test improved model against data
4. **Documentation**: Record all changes and their justification

## 4.7 Limitations and Assumptions

### 4.7.1 Data Availability Constraints

- **Limited historical data**: Small municipality with potential incomplete records
- **Informal sector**: Difficult to quantify informal waste recovery
- **Seasonal data**: May require interpolation from annual figures

### 4.7.2 Model Simplification Impact

- **Steady-state assumption**: Real system has daily/weekly variations
- **Perfect collection efficiency**: Weather and logistics impacts not modeled
- **Uniform waste composition**: Actual composition varies by season and source

2. Automated statistical analysis using realDataComparison.js
3. Error calculation and significance testing
4. Automated report generation for thesis documentation
```

### 4.9.2 Continuous Validation Capability
