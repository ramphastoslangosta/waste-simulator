# Data Collection Quick Reference & Checklist

## üöÄ **Quick Start Guide**

**Before you begin**: Read the full [DATA_COLLECTION_GUIDE.md](./DATA_COLLECTION_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Documentation System**
- [ ] Create a spreadsheet or database for tracking sources
- [ ] Set up folders for storing source documents
- [ ] Prepare citation templates for consistency

### **Step 2: Prioritize Your Data Collection**
Focus on **high-impact parameters first**:

1. **üî• CRITICAL (Highest Impact)**
   - Waste generation rates (all sources)
   - Collection system capacity
   - Material composition percentages

2. **‚ö° IMPORTANT (Medium Impact)**  
   - Economic parameters (costs/revenues)
   - Processing efficiency rates
   - Population and tourism data

3. **üìä VALUABLE (Lower Impact)**
   - Leak rates and losses
   - Special waste streams
   - Detailed operational parameters

### **Gold Standard Indicators**
- ‚úÖ Multiple independent sources agree
- ‚úÖ Primary data from your specific location
- ‚úÖ Peer-reviewed academic sources
- ‚úÖ Official government statistics
- ‚úÖ Uncertainty ranges provided

---

## üìä **Source Hierarchy (Use in Order)**

1. **ü•á PRIMARY DATA** - Your own measurements

   - Official records you accessed

2. **ü•à LOCAL OFFICIAL DATA** - Government sources
   - Municipal waste management reports
   - Census and demographic data
   - Environmental agency studies

3. **ü•â PEER-REVIEWED STUDIES** - Academic research
   - Journal articles from similar contexts
   - University research projects
   - Technical reports with methodology

4. **üìã INDUSTRY BENCHMARKS** - Professional standards
   - Waste management industry reports
   - Engineering handbooks
   - Consultant studies (with methodology)

5. **ü§ù EXPERT ESTIMATES** - Professional judgment
   - Experienced waste managers
   - Environmental engineers
   - Local experts with credentials

## ‚ö° **Rapid Data Collection Strategies**

### **When Time is Limited:**

1. **Contact Local Authorities First**
   - Municipality environmental office
   - Tourism development office  
   - Regional planning agencies

2. **Leverage Existing Networks**
   - Hotel associations for tourism data
   - Restaurant associations for food service
   - Chamber of commerce for business data

3. **Use Proxy Methods**
   - Population √ó regional per-capita rates
   - Tourism bed count √ó occupancy rates
   - Economic data from similar destinations

### **Quick Validation Techniques:**
- **Sanity Check**: Do totals make sense for population size?
- **Cross-Reference**: Do independent sources roughly agree?
- **Order of Magnitude**: Are values in reasonable ranges?
- **Seasonal Logic**: Do high/low season ratios make sense?

## üÜò **When You're Stuck**

### **Can't Find Specific Data?**
1. **Look for regional/national averages** and document adaptation
2. **Contact academic researchers** in environmental engineering
3. **Use conservative estimates** with wide uncertainty ranges
4. **Document data gaps** for future improvement priority

### **Sources Contradict Each Other?**
1. **Evaluate source quality** using hierarchy above
2. **Document the range** and use middle value
3. **Weight by source credibility** if possible
4. **Plan validation study** to resolve discrepancy

### **Data Seems Unrealistic?**
1. **Double-check units** and conversions
2. **Verify calculation methods** in source
3. **Compare with similar studies** globally
4. **Consider local context factors** that might explain differences

- **Technical Support**: Check repository issues or discussions
- **Academic Collaboration**: Consider partnering with local universities
- **Professional Networks**: Waste management engineering associations
